I want to learn how to use a vscode treeprovider.getChildren to return array of objects that will contain two levels, one for name of messageQueue and the second for the messages in messageQueue. What I want getChildren to do is just store the list of messageQueues found in the configuration and I want getChildren to store all the messages for each messageQueue into an array of objects patterned appropriately.  I would like a delay load of the messages for a messageQueue until the treeview item is expanded. In this is there a way to utilize getTreeItem to polish off the values for the treeitem in the treeview?
